Tetris ReadME

This Tetris game was originally submitted by Jeremiah Hughes about
three years ago on PSC under the name 'Miah Tetris'. It still is one
of the best Tetris versions I ever saw. I decided to do some changes
to the user interface, integrated the soundeffects in a res files,
some changes to the levels and the preview blocks, made it possible to
play more midi files(just add them into the games folder, but DON'T
use spaces in the midi filename! They are found all over the internet)
and I got out the little 'bug' (seen in many tetris clones) that
prevents you from turning a block when falling along the side.
Don't forget to put the tetris.bmp into the exe folder (you could
change the blocks view by editing this bmp.

Most important and not to be forgotten: The game code is pretty much
unchanged so THE FULL CREDITS FOR THIS GAME GOES TO Jeremiah Hughes !!!
Special thanks to him for the great code. This code is worth getting
reanimated so that every tetris fan can enjoy it again. I submit it
specially at the end of the month so that I cannot benifit of all your
votes, and that those votes are nothing more than credits to Jeremiah.
